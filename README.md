# .lua-files
It's like dotfiles, but no, it's just Lua scripts I find useful.

## Most Useful Scripts
- `popen-command-test`: A badly-named WIP script for working with the doplhin-mixtral AI model through WSL using [ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama).
- `video-dl`: A few premade command lines for using `yt-dlp` to download what I want quicker.

## Installation
1. Put this folder somewhere.
2. Add that somewhere to your path. (On Windows, search for Environment Variables (it's "part of" Control Panel) and use the UI to add them to System variables.)
3. (On Windows) Add `.LUA` to PATHEXT.
