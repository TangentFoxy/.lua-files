# .lua-files
It's like dotfiles, but no, it's just Lua scripts I find useful.

## Installation
1. Put this folder somewhere.
2. Add that somewhere to your path. (On Windows, search for Environment Variables (it's "part of" Control Panel) and use the UI to add them to System variables.)
3. (On Windows) Add `.LUA` to PATHEXT.
